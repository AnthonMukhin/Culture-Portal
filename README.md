## Technical requirements


+   Main page with portal's description  
    (+)   'author of the day' block  
    (+)   developer team description (userpics + github accounts + nicknames/names), and contribution of each member   
+  (+) Navigation  
+   Page with a list of authors
    (+)   search should be on the current language with ability to search by name, city/place of birth  
    (+)   5-7 authors are enough to complete the task successfully. You can take more, if you have enough time and willingness  
+  Page of an author with  
    (+)   Author's name  
    (+)   Years of life 
    (+)   his/her picture  
    (+)   biography in the form of timeline   
    (+)   list of artist's works with the date of creation  
    (+)   photo gallery with author's picture and pictures of his/her works  
    (+)   youtube video about the author / works / period of time author lived. Video must open in a new overlay (modal)  
    (+)   place of author's major activity on a map: google / openstreetmap (leaflet) / yandex  
    (+)   it's fine if  **not**  every element (timeline, video, photo gallery, map) will be present on every page  
(+)   Web portal must be deployed on Github Pages / netlify / google firebase / etc  
(+)   Web portal has to be in 3 languages - by, ru, en. Content may vary for each version but interface elements have to be translated. For this purposes you can use this library  or any similar;

(+) Portal should be relatively corrgit ectly displayed on tablets and mobile phones.

##### Technical limitations:

(+) You  **should**  develop portal using libraries of visual components such as  ~~*material-ui*~~  or  ***bootstrap***.

(+) You  **should**  use  _Reactjs_  or use  _gatsbyjs_  to get additional points.
